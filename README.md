# Foodmood

Foodmood is a restaurant tracker that allows you to keep records of your experiences dinging out or ordering in. Users write reviews(or notes) for the restaurants they've visted and the restaurants, cities, and cuisines are found and created for reference later.

## Installation

After cloning or downloading the project, use the bash terminal to install the gems by typing:

bundle install

After gems are installed, start the server by typing:

shotgun

Navigate to the URL given through Sinatra on a web browser.

## Usage

The Foodmood app includes login/logout for users, and an index of all reviews, restaurants, cities, and cuisines. Users may create, update, and delete their personal reviews, but may only read the reivews of other users. Creating new restuarants and cities is available to all users upon review creation, however, editing/deleting these indices is restricted to admins to prevent data loss.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run bundle install to install dependencies. You can run rake console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment in Pry.

Run shotgun to start the server or Control + C to stop the server.
